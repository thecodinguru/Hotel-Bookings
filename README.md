# Walmart Sales Data Prediction


The main objective was to forecast weekly sales for each department in 45 Walmart stores located in different regions and also to carry out statistical testing and validation of the models.

My predictive model was primarily based on linear regression

My goal is to predict which departments are affected with the holiday markdown events and the extent of impact.

I also chose to create a linear model to find a specific value for Weekly Sales that we want to predict. This line of best fit is intended to approximate further data points based on the line that we find in our training data.

Another goal is to perform dimensionality reduction to improve prediction error and to reduce overfitting.
