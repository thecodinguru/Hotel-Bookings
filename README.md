# Walmart Sales Data Prediction


The main objective was to forecast weekly sales for each department in 45 Walmart stores located in different regions and also to carry out statistical testing and validation of the models.

My goal is to predict which departments are affected with the holiday markdown events, the extent of impact and give suggestions on better discounts time.

Another goal is to perform dimensionality reduction to improve prediction error and to reduce overfitting.
